# General presentation tips

While doing an online presentation requires picking up some new skills, existing tips and tricks still apply. You're likely already familiar with everything we've highlighted here, but it's never a bad idea to take a couple of minutes and review.

## Configuring your machine

- Ensure your text size is big!
  - Let code fill the screen; it almost can't be too big
    - Tip: In Visual Studio Code, this can be done by hitting **Ctl**+**+**
- Whenever possible, zoom in
  - Many apps (especially browsers) support zooming capabilities
  - If you're presenting your whole screen from Windows, consider using [ZoomIt](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit)

## Running demos

- Ensure your demos are clear and concise
- For accessibility purposes, don't rely solely on color to make a point
- Consider having large blocks of code ready to paste
  - If you don't type your demos as you go, copy/paste of new segments can flow better than just opening a large file of code
  - You could also consider using a [user defined snippet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) in Visual Studio Code
- Don't forget to practice your demos
- Small mistakes are perfectly OK!
  - It happens to all of us!
  - It's also OK to just bail on a demo if things go sideways

## The human factor

- Be yourself!
  - We always welcome bringing personalities to streams
- Take a break if you need one
- Drinking water on stream is just fine
