# Streaming guide

Want to stream but don't know where to start? We've got you covered! This guide is designed to help get you started with streaming. The only assumed knowledge is experience with conference calls and sharing your desktop/app on an app like Teams, Skype, or Slack. Please note, you will likely need to spend a couple of hours getting a base setup put together.

## Software

The key piece of software you'll need if streaming directly is [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). OBS Studio (or simply OBS) is a powerful, open source streaming suite, and gives you complete control over building the scene for your viewers. Admittedly, OBS Studio can be a little intimidating for anyone who hasn't worked with video editing software in the past.

- [Installing and configuring the Reactor scene collection](./obs-scenes.md) (in progress)

### Software tl;dr

- Actually, on this one you're going to need to read everything :-)

## Hardware guide

While no special hardware is required, a couple of pieces can help elevate your game. We've put together a [hardware guide](./hardware.md) to help you get started.

### Hardware tl;dr

- Have a good mic
  - The one in your camera/laptop isn't going to be high quality
  - Chances are the one in your headset is ok enough if you're only planning on streaming once, but not high quality
- Consider an upgraded camera
- Don't be back-lit

## Preparing for your session

The final steps to preparing to stream is to set the scene. This includes both your physical space and tone and timber. Here's a few tips to help [prepare your stream](./peparing-your-session.md).

### Session prep tl;dr

- Take a minute to look at your backdrop for streaming
- Double check your lighting!
- Practice talking into the void while looking at a camera and not your monitor
- 100-200 level content; don't assume people meet pre-requisites
- Ensure you have a moderator to help answer questions
- Equip your moderator with links that will likely be useful to share in the chat
- Have great demos!
- Tweet out links to your session (or whatever other social media you may use)

## Streaming

Now that you've got everything done, you're ready to go live! We've put together a bit of [help for the day of streaming](./delivering-your-session.md), including the overall run of show.

### Streaming tl;dr

- Start the stream about 5 minutes beforehand with the "starting soon" scene
  - Make sure your mic is turned **off** in OBS!
- Start your presentation about 1 minute after the scheduled time
  - Make sure your mic is turned **on** in OBS!
- Look at the camera!
- Maintain a light, conversational tone
- Repeat all questions before you answer them
  - Bonus points for saying the name of the person who asked
- Leave time to answer questions at the end
- DON'T PANIC!!
