# Streaming guide

Want to stream but don't know where to start? We're here to help! This guide is designed to help get you started with streaming. The only assumed knowledge is experience with conference calls and sharing your desktop/app on an app like Teams, Skype or Slack.

You will likely need to spend a couple of hours getting a base setup put together. While no special hardware or recording room is required, you may find a couple of additions or changes to your room will help elevate the quality of your streams.

## Hardware guide

While no special hardware is required, a couple of pieces can help elevate your game. We've put together a [hardware guide](./hardware.md) to help you get started.

## Software

The key piece of software you'll need if streaming directly is [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). OBS Studio (or simply OBS) is a powerful OSS streaming suite, and gives you complete control over building the scene for your viewers. Admittedly, OBS Studio can be a little intimidating for anyone who hasn't worked with video editing software in the past.

## Streaming guideline

The final steps to preparing to stream is to set the scene. This includes both your physical space and tone and timber. We have a set of [streaming guidelines](digital-stream-guidance.md) to help you hit the right notes.
