# Before the stream

Delivering an online session involves a little more than talking one you've done in person and talking into a camera. You want to consider the environment from which you'll be speaking, make sure it fits the general tone of the Reactors, and you account for questions.

## Physical environment

While you can stream from any room you like, there are a couple of core minimum requirements you will want to consider.

- Ensure you are lit from above or in front of you; back-lighting will cause you to be too dark
  - Special lighting is not required, but you may want to consider it (details below)
- You will need a quiet room, preferably with a door
  - Soundproofing not needed
- Have a clean backdrop behind you; again, nothing fancy
  - Feel free to show some personality!
    - Bookshelves with books and other nick-knacks are great!
  - If you want to invest in a green screen you can, but this is not needed

## Online presentations

Delivering an online presentation focuses on different skills than an in person event. You will want to take a little time to update your presentation and skill set before going live.

### Talking into the void

Unlike an in-person event, you won't receive immediate feedback from your audience about how things are going. This is both because there is a delay from when you say something to when it is broadcast, and because the only feedback you will receive is through chat comments instead of the facial reactions of your audience. This can be a bit unsettling the first time you deliver a session, but it will become more comfortable with experience.

- You may find your timing will be different than an in-person event
  - Some speakers talk faster because there is no audience to interrupt them
  - Some speakers talk more because there is no audience to interrupt them
  - Some speakers talk more slowly because there is no audience to provide feedback that they've understood
- Practice presenting to the camera
  - Will help get you comfortable talking to a camera
    - Remember you will be providing all of the energy for the presentation
  - Will help you get accustomed to your pacing

### Plan for questions

Presenting while keeping an eye on the chat window is a skill which takes time to develop. It's always recommended to have a moderator in the chat to answer common questions (like links to docs or other videos), handle the easy questions, or anything off topic. Even with a mentor, you will want to have a strategy for handling questions. Some options:

- **Easiest** Let the moderator answer all questions while you present
- **Intermediate** Pause at specific times to look through the chat feed for any questions (it's totally OK to say out loud you're going to look for questions)
  - Please note, your stream will likely be on a 30 second delay, so if you're looking for live interaction it will take a bit of time
- **Advanced** Keep an eye on the chat window while presenting and answer questions as you feel comfortable

## Preparing your presentation

Our goal is to discuss cutting edge, technical content targeted mainly to startup and/or somewhat new developers. We do this by focusing primarily on 100-200 level content while fostering a community of learning and encourage questions. We lead with demos whenever possible, and provide real world examples.

### Pictures and drawings

You won't have physical whiteboards or other tools at your disposal when streaming. But there are a lot of options you do have:

- Add diagrams to your slide deck to describe concepts
  - No need for them to be fancy, just clean
  - Animations not required
- Drawing tools can help focus attention or allow you to draw on the fly
  - PowerPoint shapes can make it easy to create diagrams on the fly
  - Even an application like Paint can be helpful
  - If sharing your desktop on Windows, use [ZoomIt](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit) to draw on your screen

### Demos are key

Demos are probably the most commonly requested component of any technical presentation. Developers want to see the code! So, as much as is possible, incorporate demos into your presentation.

- Have a repo ready to go with your final code so viewers can follow along
- You're free to use pre-canned files or type live
  - Consider using snippets as a happy medium
- Practice highlighting code sections to draw focus (or use ZoomIt)

### Tone

When putting together your presentation, make sure you allow for introductions and other components. Some considerations for your presentation:

- Include an introduction section
  - By all means feel free to highlight a hobby or other personal note if you like
  - Keep introductions relatively short
- Typically, viewers will have limited experience with the technology you're discussing
  - Define all [TLAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym) when you use them for the first time
  - Take a couple of minutes off the top of your session to make sure you set expectations appropriately
    - What will you cover?
    - What **won't** you cover?
- Simplifying the content is OK
  - If you're not sure if something is too advanced for the audience, it probably is
  - Err on the side or reinforcing knowledge than confusing the viewer

## Tell the world!!

Imagine throwing a party and having nobody show up! We've asked you to present because you're an expert and people want to listen to you. As such, you can help bring people to your stream by tweeting or posting the Meetup link provided. When you're about to go live don't forget to tweet/post the link to the stream.
