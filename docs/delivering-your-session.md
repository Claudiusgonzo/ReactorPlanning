# Delivering your session

It's time to go live! Deep breath - you've got this!

Couple of last notes to keep in mind

## Getting started

- Begin your stream five minutes before your scheduled start time with the **Starting soon** scene
  - Make sure your mic is muted :-D
- Start with introductions
  - Introduce yourself and any co-hosts
    - Try to limit the amount of time spent on introductions
    - People are there to see you in action!!
  - Introduce your topic and target audience
    - Highlight your outline
    - Set pre-requisites for the audience
    - Consider touching on topics you won't cover

### During the session

- Answer any questions you feel comfortable based on your [questions plan](./preparing-your-session.md#Preparing-for-questions)
  - Always repeat the question as not everyone may have seen it
  - Say the name of the person who asked the question
- Roll with the punches; mistakes happen
  - Demos may fail
  - You may forget something or where you are
- Bring the energy
  - Speaking into the void is a little weird
  - You provide all of the energy
