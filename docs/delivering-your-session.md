    - Set pre-requisites for the audience
    - Consider touching on topics you won't cover

## During the session

- Answer any questions you feel comfortable based on your [questions plan](./preparing-your-session.md#Plan-for-questions)
  - Always repeat the question as not everyone may have seen it
  - Say the name of the person who asked the question
- Roll with the punches; mistakes happen
  - Demos may fail
  - You may forget something or where you are
  - Not everyone will resonate with this particularly stream, that's OK!

  - You provide ALL of the energy
