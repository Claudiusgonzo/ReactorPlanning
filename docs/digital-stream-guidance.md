# <b>Guidance for Hosting a Digital Streaming Session</b>

Thank you for agreeing to host an upcoming Reactor stream online! We currently (Summer 2020) stream primarily on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/microsoftdeveloper) for global events and on Teams Live for localized events. This quick guide will help orientate you to the goals and guidance to ensure you deliver a high quality, informative, and professional live stream. 

All Reactor streams should share the following attributes: 

* Discuss cutting edge, technical content targeted mainly to startup and/or somewhat new developers 

* Focus primarily on 100-200 level content 

* Maintain a casual, welcoming tone  

* Foster a community of learning and encourage questions and comments </ul>

 

As you prepare your session content, follow these steps: 

## Before Your Stream 

| Timeline  | Task |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| More than 8 weeks prior  | **Submit a title and description for your stream**. Email it to  the Reactor TPM Owner responsible for the week of your stream, as listed in the [General Event Schedule](https://github.com/microsoft/ReactorPlanning#general-event-schedule). |
| 8 weeks prior   | **Contact your [TPM Owner](https://github.com/microsoft/ReactorPlanning#general-event-schedule)** to confirm that your stream submission was accepted. and an Issue has been created to publish and market it (you can check status in the [Issues list](https://github.com/microsoft/ReactorPlanning/issues)).  You and your moderator will be marked as an assignee to the issue tracking your event. Additionally, someone from the Reactor Content Team will also be marked as an assignee; you can reach out to them for any questions.| 
| 6 weeks prior | **Choose a moderator** (if you haven’t done so already). <p><p>Moderator Responsibilities:</p><p> * The moderator is a second person in the stream who attends to the stream’s chat window and fosters a community of positive encouragement. (The streamer may also interact in the chat, but the moderator is ultimately responsible.)</p> <p>* Moderators respond to questions or comments in the chat window and call out relevant topics to the host’s attention for further discussion.</p> <p>* Moderators should have a list of links for further learning prepared, as well as links to any code that the viewers might want to reference. </p>|
 | 2 weeks prior | **Begin preparing your session content**. Use [this template](https://slidedecks.blob.core.windows.net/reactorslides/Twitch%20Stream%20Template.potx). <p>Note the required slides (*Starting Soon* and *Closing*). If your planned session is longer than 60 minutes, please consider adding the *Break* slide and include a 5-minute recess about ½ way through. |
| 1 week prior | 1. **Set up your technical environment**. <p><p>You will need tools such as OBS, a stream key, etc. Refer to these supporting documents for technical support: <p>https://aka.ms/LivestreamonTwitch <p>https://aka.ms/obssetup <p>https://aka.ms/streammsftdev <p>To obtain a stream key (a code used to identify the source of the audio/video streaming). Send an email to [Brian Clark](mailto:brian.clark@microsoft.com) and include the email address you use on Twitch. <p>2. **Promote your session on your social channels**. Use the link to your session that is available on the [Meetup Events Page](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Redmond/events/). <p>You will receive a reminder email from the Reactor team. It will include an overview of your session date/time, title, and description. Verify all session details are correct, fill out the session info requested in the table and reply back. |
| 1 day prior  | **Verify that your stream setup is working** (stream key, camera and microphone, OBS).  <p>Refer to these supporting documents for technical support: <p>https://aka.ms/LivestreamonTwitch <p>https://aka.ms/obssetup <p>https://aka.ms/streammsftdev  |
| 15-30 minutes prior | **Block out your calendar** to allow for setup and address any technical issues that might occur.  <p>Conduct one more stream setup check (microphone, camera are working). <p>Connect with your moderator to make sure he/she is online and ready for questions.  |

 ## During Your Stream 
| Timeline  | Task |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 5 minutes before start time | **Display the *Starting Soon* slide** (from the [Digital Streaming template](https://slidedecks.blob.core.windows.net/reactorslides/Twitch%20Stream%20Template.potx)) in your session window. Make sure your microphone is not on during this time so that you don’t say anything unintended. | 
| General Tips | * Start on time. <p>* Introduce yourself, your moderator, and your topic. <p>* Remind attendees of the chat window and encourage them to interact. <p>IMPORTANT: The speaker and moderator should welcome each commenter who joins the chat. This is a small but crucial step in fostering an inclusive, welcoming environment. Use their names and make an immediate connection. <p>* Maintain a casual, friendly, and authentic tone throughout the session. We highly encourage you to bring your own flavor/personality, PC humor, quips, and quirks! <p>* You or your moderator should respond to comments in the chat window promptly. <p>* If the question is something you will cover later, acknowledge the question immediately and indicate as such. <p>* Restate the questions in the chat window before you answer them—this is for the on-demand YouTube audience who won’t see the chat window.  |

## At the Conclusion of Your Stream 
|   | Task |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  |1. **Display the *Closing* slide**.<p><p> 2. **Thank attendees and remind them**: <p>   * That your stream will be uploaded to the [Reactor YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkm6luGCS3hD25jcEhvRMIA) at the end of the week for on-demand access.    <p> * Moderator: link to the Reactor YouTube page and any relevant future sessions in the chat window.  |
