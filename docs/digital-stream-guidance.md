# Guidance for Hosting a Digital Streaming Session

## Physical environment

While you can stream from any room you like, there are a couple of core minimum requirements you will want to consider.

- You will need a quiet room, preferably with a door
  - Soundproofing not needed
- Ensure you are lit from above or in front of you; back-lighting will cause you to be too dark
  - Special lighting is not required, but you may want to consider it (details below)
- Have a clean backdrop behind you; again, nothing fancy
  - Feel free to show some personality!
  - If you want to invest in a green screen you can, but this is not needed

## Tone

- Discuss cutting edge, technical content targeted mainly to startup and/or somewhat new developers
  - Focus primarily on 100-200 level content
- Foster a community of learning and encourage questions and comments
  - Have a system in place for answering questions
    - Consider having a mentor to answer questions or bubble them up to you
      - Maybe have a back-channel form of communication
    - Always say the question out loud
      - Streams are made available on demand afterwards, so viewers may not see the question
  - Maintain a casual, welcoming tone

## Digital

- Begin your stream five minutes before your scheduled start time with the **Starting soon** scene
  - Make sure your mic is muted :-D
- Start with introductions
  - Introduce yourself and any co-hosts
    - Try to limit the amount of time spent on introductions
    - People are there to see you in action!!
  - Introduce your topic and target audience
    - Highlight your outline
    - Set pre-requisites for the audience
    - Consider touching on topics you won't cover
