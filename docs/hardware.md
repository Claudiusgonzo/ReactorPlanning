# Hardware

Streaming **does not** necessarily require purchasing new hardware. However, a couple of items, in particular a [microphone](#Audio), can raise the quality of your stream for a relatively small investment.

This guide was written during the COVID pandemic. As a result, the hardware listed below may be a challenge to source or purchase at a reasonable price. Keep in mind you may be able to expense hardware; always ask your manager.

## Audio

Ironically, audio is more important than video when streaming. Viewers are typically less concerned with lower quality video than they are audio. Also, the core of the information being shared during a video is conveyed via audio as the speaker is explaining various concepts.

Furthermore, if your bandwidth is low you should opt to turn off your video, but you will always need your audio.

As a general rule, microphones built into cameras and laptops are inadequate for streaming purposes. Microphones in headphones are generally acceptable, but it's strongly recommended you do a quick recording to listen to how it sounds.

Common options (All prices US):

- [Blue Snowball](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/snowball/) (~ $70)
- [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-x/) (~ $170)
- [Audio-Technica AT2050](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/fb4dbcab747f4176/index.html) (~ $230)

## Video

If you are using your laptop to stream, chances are the built-in camera is perfectly acceptable. Because your camera won't be full-screen for a long period of time on normal streams the quality isn't as important. However, you may decide the angle isn't quite right, or you would like a higher quality camera, especially if you are going to be putting your camera on full-screen during longer explanations.

- [Logitech C920S](https://www.logitech.com/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920s) (~ $70)
- [Logitech BRIO](https://www.logitech.com/product/brio) (~ $200)

## Lighting

Good lighting is as important to focus and clarity as the camera. Low or poor lighting means the camera needs to struggle to focus, or will use a higher [ISO value](https://photographylife.com/what-is-iso-in-photography) leading to fuzzier images. Investing in special lighting isn't necessary, but it will improve the quality of the stream. Regardless of the lighting source you choose, keep in mind back-lighting (having the light source behind or to the side of you) will cause the shot to be dark.

- Ring lights, which are available all over Amazon for under $50.
- [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/gaming/key-light) (~ $200) (You will want two to avoid shadows)

## Computer

While no special hardware is required for streaming, you will find your experience will be enhanced if you meet an additional couple of prerequisites.

### Dual monitors

Having a second monitor will allow you to share one screen while using the second to keep an eye on how the stream running, questions coming in, and managing scene transitions.

### Discrete GPU (dGPU)

A dGPU is a [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) with its own dedicated memory and processing board. Many laptops, however, use an [integrated GPU](https://www.techdim.com/what-is-integrated-graphics-card/), meaning resources are shared. Because streaming can be a graphics intensive operation, you may want to consider a device with a dGPU such as a Surface Book or a desktop PC.

### Wired internet

As we all know, wireless networks are convenient but finnicky. For best performance and stability, it's strongly recommended your streaming device be hardwired to your network.
