# Hardware

Streaming **does not** necessarily require purchasing new hardware. However, a couple of items, in particular a [microphone](#audio), can raise the quality of your stream for a relatively small investment.

This guide was written during the COVID pandemic. As a result, the hardware listed below may be a challenge to source or purchase at a reasonable price. Keep in mind you may be able to expense hardware; always ask your manager.

## Audio

Ironically, audio is more important than video when streaming. Viewers are typically less concerned with lower quality video than they are audio. Also, the core of the information being shared during a video is conveyed via audio as the speaker is explaining various concepts.

As a general rule, microphones built into cameras and laptops are inadequate for streaming purposes. Microphones in headphones are generally acceptable, but it's strongly recommended you do a quick recording to listen to how it sounds.

## Video

If you are using your laptop to stream, chances are the built-in camera is perfectly acceptable. Because your camera won't be full-screen for a long period of time on normal streams the quality isn't as important. However, you may decide the angle isn't quite right, or you would like a higher quality camera, especially if you are going to be putting your camera on full-screen during longer explanations.

## Lighting

Good lighting is as important to focus and clarity as the camera. Low or poor lighting means the camera needs to struggle to focus, or will use a higher [ISO value](https://photographylife.com/what-is-iso-in-photography) leading to fuzzier images. Investing in special lighting isn't necessary, but it will improve the quality of the stream. Regardless of the lighting source you choose, keep in mind back-lighting (having the light source behind or to the side of you) will cause the shot to be dark.
