# OBS Studio

[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) is a professional level streaming suite. OBS Studio (or just OBS) gives you the ability to build various scenes, control your camera and microphone, choose what to share, and broadcast to numerous platforms including Twitch, YouTube, and Teams Live.

## Before you get started

Before you get started, you will need a stream key. Please contact the program manager you're working with to obtain the key.

## Hardware requirements

While OBS requires no special hardware, it can be rather resource and you may want a second monitor. We've provided some [suggestions for the computer to use for streaming](hardware.md#Computer).

## Installation
