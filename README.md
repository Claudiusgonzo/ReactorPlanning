# Reactor Event and Content Planning Repository

Welcome! This repository will be tracking the planning for digital and in-person Reactor events.

## Event Planning

Reactors hold events both in-person and digitally. As of Summer 2020, all events are currently being help digitally. This is a combination of Global Live Twitch Streams and Local Live Teams Events. To better partner with the rest of the Azure Developer and Cloud Advocacy teams, we are aligning our topics to the [Azure Developer Marketing Calendar](https://aka.ms/DevEdCalFY21H1).

In this README, you can find the following regarding events:

- General Event Schedule of topics that aligns to the [Azure Developer Marketing Calendar](https://aka.ms/DevEdCalFY21H1)
- FAQ on how to sign up to run/speak at a Reactor Event

### General Event Schedule

We have published an overall [schedule of events](./schedule.md).

### I want to speak at a Reactor event

Great! We often have openings for speakers! We do require 8-weeks advance notice of all new events to be able to market them properly. We manage our schedule via GitHub issues, so you can see [our list of sessions where we are actively seeking help](https://github.com/microsoft/ReactorPlanning/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Our calendar is rarely set in stone, so we are always open to suggestions. If you have a topic which you think we should cover or see a session you'd like to deliver, please feel free to either comment on an issue or file one of your own!

## Reactor Content Development

Part of the mission of the Reactors is to create lasting content for developers to be able to refer back and continue their learning journeys. The customer facing content will reside on a number of Microsoft platforms, depending on the goal of that piece of content. This repository will track the development of new content regardless of its target platform destination.

### Microsoft Learn Modules

[Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/) is a learning platform that consists mainly of tutorial-like content. This is an ideal platform for Reactor content that is:

- Reference material for further learning before, during, or after an event
- Material that is covered in Reactor events that builds upon content that already exists in the Microsoft Learn ecosystem

The goals of publishing content to Microsoft Learn are to:

- Provide students an entry point to additional Reactor content on Microsoft Learn through embedded references in modules
- Provide students an entry point to Microsoft Learn through Reactor events and marketing
- Ensure Reactor content fits within the larger Microsoft learning framework
- Provide students with a clearer pathway through Microsoft learning content

### Reactor Learn Modules

| Module or Learning Path Title | Duration | Reactor TPM and Author | Date Published | Technologies Referenced | Live Learn Link |
|-------------------------------|----------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------|

### Getting started with creating content on Microsoft Learn

This process, from the Reactor point of view, is still being defined. While reference material that will generally support Reactor events is of interested, we are also dedicated to creating content and experiences on the Microsoft Learn platform that is more interactive and could be used during instructor-led events. The best option at the moment is to create a new [Learn Module Tracking Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/ReactorPlanning/issues/new?assignees=&labels=content-development%2C+learn&template=learn-module-tracking-issue.md&title=Topic+-+Est+Publish+Date) and follow the steps there!
